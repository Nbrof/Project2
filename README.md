# Project Overview

## Project Links

- [add your github repo link](https://github.com/Nbrof/Project2)
- [add your deployment link](https://project2-orcin.vercel.app/)

## Project Description

An webpage that is capable of rendering various XKDC comics across itself. User's will be able to input a number which will grab the XKDC comic in quiestion. 



## API

Use this section to include info about the API you have chosen and a code snippet of the data that it returns and is required for your project. 


```
Link to API page: https://xkcd.vercel.app/?comic=303

{Comictest {month: "4", num: 2456, link: "", year: "2021", news: "", …} }
```


## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

- [add link to your wireframes]()
- [add link to your react architecture]()


### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to interact with the page

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Add localStorage or firebase for storage

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Comic | This will render the comic that is pulled from the API| 
| Infobox | This will render information, Including proper copyright information|
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 

Note: Multiple Comic components TBD


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Information Research | M | 3hrs| | |
| Basic App/Component Structuring| H | 3hrs| | |
| Router Structuring | L | 2hrs| | |
| API Manipulation | H | 2hrs| | |
| API Element Rendering| H | 3hrs| | |

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code. 

```
function reverse(string) {
