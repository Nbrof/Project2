- [Deployed Webpage](https://project2-orcin.vercel.app/)

## Project Description

An webpage that is capable of rendering various XKDC comics across itself. User's will be able to input a number which will grab the XKDC comic in quiestion. 



## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.

|Day 5| Present | Incomplete




## API

Use this section to include info about the API you have chosen and a code snippet of the data that it returns and is required for your project. 


```
Link to API page: https://xkcd.vercel.app/?comic=303

{Comictest {
	
	
alt: "Others include \"We've incrementally improved the estimate of this coefficient,\" \"Maybe all these categories are wrong,\" and \"We found a way to make student volunteers worse at tasks.\""

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to interact with a button to grab a random comic
- Allow user to input some numbers to select a comic
- Basic styling 
- Ensuring Responsiveness

#### PostMVP 

- Advanced Styling and details.
- Additional Comic snippets
- Animation effects
- Research into incorperating additional Libraries.

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Comic | This will render the comic that is pulled from the API| 
| Infobox | This will render information, Including proper copyright information|
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 

Note: Multiple Comic components TBD


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project such as Axios, ReactStrap, D3, etc.

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code. 

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
